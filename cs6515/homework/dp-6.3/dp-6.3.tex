\section{Exercise 6.3}

\subsection{Problem}

Yuckdonald's is considering opening a series of restaurants along Quaint Valley Highway (QVH). The \(n\) possible locations are along a straight line, and the distances of these locations from the start of QVH are, in miles and in increasing order, \(m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n\). The constraints are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item At each location, Yuckdonald's may open at most one restaurant. The expected profit from opening a restaurant at location \(i\) is \(p_i\), where \(p_i > 0\) and \(i = 1,2,\dots,n\).
    \item Any two restaurants should be at least \(k\) miles apart, where \(k\) is a positive integer.
\end{itemize}
    
Give an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum expected total profit subject to the given constraints.

\subsection{Solution}

% Test Case
% M =   1,  2,  3,   5,  8,   9, 10
% P =  10,  5, 20,  50, 30,  35,  2
% R = *10, 10, 20, *60, 90, *95, 95
